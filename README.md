## 🔄 How It Works

```
1. TOKENIZE AIRCRAFT
   Aircraft Owner → Lists aircraft details and specifications 
                 → Aircraft verified and approved 
                 → Tokenization contract deployed
                 → Digital tokens created on QIE blockchain

2. INVEST WITH QIE
   Investors → Browse available aircraft tokens 
            → Purchase fractional ownership (tokens)
            → Funds locked in smart contract
            → Ownership recorded on blockchain

3. EARN & TRADE
   Token Holders → Receive share of aircraft revenue
                → Receive automatic dividend distributions
                → Trade tokens on marketplace
                → Monitor real-time performance metrics
```
